# RoboScouting
RoboScouting (Temporary name) is a cross-platform scouting application for the *FIRST* Robotics Competition *(FRC)*. RoboScouting is currently developed and maintained by alumin from Team 7103 Robo Remedy from Manitowoc, WI.

We will aim to keep the documentation as up-to-date as possible, but expect it to be a few commits behind.
